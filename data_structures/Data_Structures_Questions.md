Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method? 1^n === 1 for the recursion so I think O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function? O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function? O(nlogn)

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
newArray => O(n^2)
alteredArray => O(n)
